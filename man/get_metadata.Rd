\arguments{
\item{restopt_solution}{\code{\link{RestoptSolution}} Restopt solution
to this solution.}
}
\value{
A list containing the characteristics of the restopt solution.
}
\description{
Return the metadata associated with a restopt solution, which contains
the characteristics of the solution. The unit for area characteristics
