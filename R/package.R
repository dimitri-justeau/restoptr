#' `restoptr`: Ecological Restoration Planning with R
#'
#' The `restoptr` package relies on Constraint Programming (CP) to build and
#' solve ecological restoration planning problems. A `restoptr` problem starts
#' from an existing habitat (raster), where the aim is to identify optimal areas
#' that are suitable for restoration. Several constraints are available to define
#' what is expected for a suitable area for (e.g. it must be connected, compact,
#' must respect a budget, etc). Several optimization objective are also available
#' to define what is a good restoration area (e.g. it must reduce fragmentation,
#' increase ecological connectivity, minimize costs, etc.). `restoptr` relies on
#' advanced landscape indices such as the effective mesh size (Jaeger, 2000),
#' or the integral index of connectivity (Pascual-Hortal & Saura, 2006) to address
#' complex restoration planning problems.
#'
#' @details `restoptr` relies on Choco-solver (https://choco-solver.org/), an open-source
#' Java CP solver (Prud'homme et al., 2017). The computationally intensive solving
#' part is thus delegated to Java (see `restopt`, https://github.com/dimitri-justeau/restopt),
#' and the communication between R and Java is handled with the `rJava` package.
#' Therefore, a Java Runtime Environment (>= 8) is necessary to use `restopt`.
#'
#' Note that the methodology used in `restoptr` was first described in
#' Justeau-Allaire et al. (2021), but `restoptr` provides much more flexibility,
#' new features (e.g. reliable and consistent data preprocessing), new constraints,
#' new optimization objectives, and an improved computational efficiency. Also
#' note that the API was inspired by the `prioritizr` package.
#'
#' This package contains several vignettes to detail its usage and
#' showcase its features. You can explore these vignettes using
#' `browseVignettes("restoptr")`
